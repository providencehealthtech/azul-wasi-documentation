## Finding the Form

There are three ways to get to the new child form in OpenEMR:

1. The "Search or Add Child" tab is open by default, just click on the Tab Title.
2. On the Children List tab (the default tab) you can click the "Add Child" button.
3. You can also hover over the "Child" menu option and click "New/Search".

The only optional field on the form is Sex, which can be left Unassigned. All other fields are required.

## Possible Duplicates

OpenEMR automatically checks for duplicate patients. A popup is shown.

### Possible Duplicates

If there **are** possible duplicates, they will be listed in the popup. Clicking on the row will take you to the
suggested patient. Clicking "Confirm New Patient" will create the patient, ignoring the alert.
