Allergy management is one of the core functionalities of the Azul Wasi OpenEMR installation.

## Viewing Allergies

Allergy information can be viewed from the Medical Records Dashboard. See 
[Medical Record Dashboard Overview](medical-record-dashboard/overview.html) for more information. Once on the Medical
Records Dashboard, Allergies are listed on the right column.
